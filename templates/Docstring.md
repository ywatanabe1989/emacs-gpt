Please include docstrings.
Especially, the format should be Arguments, Attributes for classes, Return, data types, data shapes, and references.
Numpy or Torch should be clear.
If it's possible, please implement the function to work both on numpy.array, pytorch.tensor, and even pandasDataFrame.
If one of them can work, please add suffix like compute_fft_np, compute_fft_torch, or compute_fft_df.
Also, please tell me if more appropriate name can be. In this case, please implement obsolete warning for future compatibility.
